# Mottagningen

This is a very simple and LiU-adapted CMS. It was created by me to provide the committee for the introduction weeks for two programs -- Master of science in Engineering focusing on computer science and media technology and the bachelor's programme in graphic design and communication -- at Linköping University in Norrköping.
